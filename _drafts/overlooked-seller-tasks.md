{% include youtube.html %}I’m sharing four important seller tasks not to overlook when preparing your home for the market.&nbsp;

In the shuffle of everything you need to do when selling your house, some things can be forgotten. Today I’m discussing what tasks are most overlooked by sellers when they’re preparing to list their home:

**1\. Staging.** You may like the way your furniture is placed, but it might not be the best use of the space or it may not show off the room’s best qualities.&nbsp;

**2\. Curb appeal.** Don’t let the exterior slip through the cracks. If you fail to give the outside of your home the love it deserves, you may not get buyers to look at the inside.&nbsp;

**3\. Update lighting and hardware.** Buyers love light, bright rooms, so update lighting, hardware, and fixtures. Make sure the lighting is cohesive throughout your house. Use a combination of overhead lights and lamps to create a welcoming atmosphere for buyers.&nbsp;

**4\. Minimize decor.** In addition to depersonalizing your home, you should also consider toning down your decor. Your brightly colored walls may be a reflection of your personality, but they might be a massive turn off to certain buyers. It’s safest to stick with neutral colors such as gray, white, and taupe.**&nbsp;**
